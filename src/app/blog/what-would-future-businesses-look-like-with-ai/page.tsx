            <p>
              Imagine a world where your AI assistant knows your customers
              better than you do. It analyzes vast amounts of data to predict
              customer needs, preferences, and behaviors with uncanny accuracy.
              As a solo entrepreneur or freelancer, you'll be able to offer
              tailored products and services that feel almost clairvoyant in
              their relevance.

              Designers might describe a logo concept to an AI, which then
              generates multiple options. Writers could outline a story, and AI
              would flesh out the details.
